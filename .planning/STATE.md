# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-01)

**Core value:** Agents build with the same components humans see -- consistency is enforced infrastructure, not guidelines
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — frontend-scaffold-websocket

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (frontend-scaffold-websocket) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Frontend is a rebuild (not migration) -- clean `src/workbenches/` directory, preserve backend/shared/actionflows
- [Roadmap]: TypeScript debt fixed first -- agents imitate whatever patterns exist, so patterns must be clean before agent work begins
- [Roadmap]: Design system before layout -- component library is infrastructure that layout and all subsequent phases compose from
- [Roadmap]: Lazy session activation -- only active workbench holds a live session to avoid token budget explosion
- [Phase 01]: Used type narrowing guards ('timestamp' in event) for WorkspaceEvent union access instead of extending BaseEvent
- [Phase 01]: RedisStorage user methods use userId field matching User interface in auth/roles.ts
- [Phase 01]: Used duration.ms() instead of toDurationMs() since toDurationMs not re-exported from @afw/shared index
- [Phase 01]: Added optional delete() to Storage interface for KV operations (same pattern as set/get/keys)
- [Phase 01]: Used brandedTypes.currentTimestamp() for UniverseGraph init metadata instead of string casts
- [Phase 02]: Made WebSocketHub hub parameter optional in handleWebSocket for backward compat with test helpers
- [Phase 02]: Used lightweight WSEnvelope interface (not Zod schema) in @afw/shared for shared contract flexibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Agent SDK `unstable_v2` methods may change before Phase 6 implementation -- monitor changelog
- Tailwind v4 + Electron build pipeline needs end-to-end verification in Phase 2
- `/btw` injection path into active Agent SDK sessions is undocumented -- needs investigation in Phase 8
