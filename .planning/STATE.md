# Project State

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Frontend is a rebuild (not migration) -- clean `src/workbenches/` directory, preserve backend/shared/actionflows
- [Roadmap]: TypeScript debt fixed first -- agents imitate whatever patterns exist, so patterns must be clean before agent work begins
- [Roadmap]: Design system before layout -- component library is infrastructure that layout and all subsequent phases compose from
- [Roadmap]: Lazy session activation -- only active workbench holds a live session to avoid token budget explosion

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Agent SDK `unstable_v2` methods may change before Phase 6 implementation -- monitor changelog
- Tailwind v4 + Electron build pipeline needs end-to-end verification in Phase 2
- `/btw` injection path into active Agent SDK sessions is undocumented -- needs investigation in Phase 8
