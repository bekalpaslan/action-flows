## Presentation

Congratulations! You've completed the ActionFlows onboarding questionnaire.

Here's what you learned:

### Beginner Level ✅
```
├── The core cycle (compilation → approval → execution)
├── Sacred formats (contract-defined, dashboard-parsed)
├── Safe evolution (flows, actions, routing—change freely)
├── The sin test (orchestrator coordinates, never produces)
└── Quick reference card
```

### Intermediate Level ✅
```
├── Department routing (ORGANIZATION.md)
├── Review pipeline (primary + second opinion)
└── Action modes (assess vs assess+fix)
```

### Advanced Level ✅
```
├── The contract (harmony bridge)
├── Format anatomy (structure, types, parsers, components)
├── Harmony detection (auto-validation)
└── Living software model (synchronized evolution)
```

## You Now Understand

- ✅ How to use ActionFlows safely
- ✅ How to customize flows and actions
- ✅ How to evolve the framework without breaking harmony
- ✅ The philosophy of living software
- ✅ What's sacred vs what's safe
- ✅ The sin test and orchestrator boundaries
- ✅ Department routing and flow composition
- ✅ Review pipeline and second opinions
- ✅ Contract-based harmony system

- Safe evolution checklist
- The sin test (simple version)
- Emergency commands ("it's a sin")
- Common request examples
- When to compile chains vs quick triage

**Completion Certificate:**
Location: `.claude/actionflows/logs/onboarding/{datetime}/completion-certificate.md`

Contains:
- Completion date
- Modules completed
- Level achieved (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Next steps
- Where to get help

**Session Log:**
Location: `.claude/actionflows/logs/onboarding/{datetime}/session-log.md`

Contains:
- Full transcript of questions and answers
- Module progression
- Navigation choices
- Quiz responses

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Try a simple request
Example: `"I have an idea—add keyboard shortcuts to the dashboard"`

Watch orchestrator compile chain, approve, observe execution

### 2. Customize routing
Edit ORGANIZATION.md to add triggers for your team's language

### 3. Create a custom flow
Try: `"Create a flow called docs-review/ for reviewing documentation"`

### 4. Join the evolution loop
When agents report learnings, approve the fixes—watch framework improve

### 5. Read CONTRACT.md
Browse all formats to see what's defined

## Final Question

Before we finish, what would you like to do?

1. Review a specific module (which one?)
2. Get quiz on key concepts
3. See example of a real request flow
4. Start using ActionFlows immediately
5. Save and exit

What's your choice?

## Completion Actions

Based on human choice:
- **Review** → Return to chosen module, then offer completion again
- **Quiz** → Additional validation questions, then completion
- **Example** → Show real request → chain compilation → execution flow
- **Start using** → "Ready when you are! Just say what you need."
- **Save and exit** → Generate completion certificate and exit

---

## Registry Update

Add entry to `logs/INDEX.md`:
```markdown
| {YYYY-MM-DD} | ActionFlows onboarding | onboarding/ | Completed — {level} level |
```

## Key Principles Summary

**The Sin Test:**
- Orchestrator coordinates, never produces
- Say "it's a sin" to reset boundary violations

**Sacred vs Safe:**
- Dashboard PARSES it → Sacred
- Dashboard READS it → Safe

**The Core Cycle:**
1. Compilation (see the plan)
2. Approval (you control it)
3. Execution (trust the system)

**Harmony:**
- Contract keeps orchestrator and dashboard in sync
- Living software evolves through coordinated updates
- Harmony detection auto-validates

**Evolution:**
- Add flows freely (FLOWS.md)
- Add actions freely (ACTIONS.md)
- Customize routing (ORGANIZATION.md)
- Contract changes require coordination

**Congratulations on completing ActionFlows onboarding!**

You're now equipped to use, customize, and evolve this living software system.
