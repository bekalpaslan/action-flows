**Level:** Beginner
**Duration:** ~10 min
**Prerequisites:** None

## Presentation

Welcome to ActionFlows! I'm going to teach you how this framework works through a series of interactive modules.

This framework has three parts:
1. **Orchestrator (coordinator)** — Routes requests, compiles chains, spawns agents
2. **Dashboard (visualizer)** — Shows real-time progress, logs, and quality metrics
3. **Contract (harmony bridge)** — Keeps orchestrator output and dashboard parsing in sync

We'll go through this in levels:
- **Beginner (5 modules, ~45 min)** — How to use the framework safely
- **Intermediate (2 modules, ~35 min)** — How to customize flows and actions
- **Advanced (2 modules, ~55 min)** — How to evolve the framework itself

You can skip levels if you're already familiar, or go back anytime.

**The Living Universe:**

ActionFlows is not just software—it's a **living universe** where these three parts form a symbiotic triad:

**The Physics-Brain-Will Triad:**

- **Software (Physics)** = The raw laws that govern this universe. The code is imperfect, mutable, the foundation everything runs on.
- **Orchestrator (Brain)** = The intelligence that understands the physics and **has the power to change them**. The orchestrator can rewrite the code itself.
- **Agents (Hands)** = The executors that work within the physics, transforming it according to the brain's decisions.
- **You (Human/Will)** = You set intention and make decisions. You express what you want; the brain figures out how to reshape the physics.

Together, you form a living organism that **grows through use**. The more you work with ActionFlows, the smarter it becomes—not through configuration, but through **organic evolution**.

**Your Journey:**

As you progress through these modules, you're not just learning a tool—you're exploring a universe. Some capabilities are revealed immediately. Others you'll discover through use. This is **software as adventure**.

## Initial Question

First, let me understand your role. Which best describes you?

1. **Project manager** — I'll be requesting work, approving chains
2. **Developer** — I'll be customizing flows and adding actions
3. **Framework architect** — I'll be evolving ActionFlows itself
4. **All of the above**

This helps me tailor the teaching.

## Expected Answer

Any of 1-4 (store as `role` for emphasis in later modules)

## Key Takeaway

You now know:
- The three parts of ActionFlows (orchestrator, dashboard, contract)
- The three learning levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Your role in the system
