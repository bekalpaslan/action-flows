# Execution Logs

> History of framework executions. Orchestrator reads before compiling new chains.

## Structure

- `INDEX.md` — Pattern registry: what was executed, when, outcome
- `LEARNINGS.md` — Accumulated insights
- `{action-type}/{description}_{datetime}/` — Individual execution folders

## Retention

- Keep recent executions (last 30 days)
- LEARNINGS.md entries persist indefinitely
- INDEX.md entries can be pruned when logs are deleted
