FRONTEND ANALYSIS COMPLETE
==========================

Scope: packages/app/ (React + Vite + Electron + ReactFlow)
Aspect: inventory + functionality
Mode: analyze-only

REPORT LOCATION:
D:\ActionFlowsDashboard\.claude\actionflows\logs\analyze\frd-srd-analysis_2026-02-08-16-56-16\frontend-analysis.md

KEY FINDINGS:
- Total Source Files: 96 (TS/TSX/CSS)
- Components: 21 directories with ~41 component files (~7172 LOC)
- Custom Hooks: 25 hooks (~3086 LOC)
- Contexts: 1 (WebSocketContext)
- Services: 2 (ClaudeCliService, ProjectService)
- Utilities: 5-7 modules

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
✅ ~85% COMPLETE
- Core architecture and all major components implemented
- Real-time WebSocket integration working
- Multiple visualization modes (DAG, Timeline, Grid)
- Code editor with Monaco and file sync
- Terminal integration with xterm.js
- Session and user management
- Claude CLI integration with session discovery

⏳ PARTIAL (6 features):
- Session archive (basic, missing filters/export)
- DAG visualization (being replaced by FlowVisualization)
- Keyboard shortcuts (basic implementation)
- Live monitoring (placeholder)
- History browser (needs completion)

🚧 TODO (5 screens):
- Dashboard screen
- Flows screen
- Actions screen
- Logs screen
- Settings screen (partial)

COMPONENT INVENTORY:
41 components organized in 21 directories:
- Layout & Structure: AppContent, SplitPaneLayout, SessionPane, etc.
- Visualization: FlowVisualization, AnimatedStepNode, TimelineView, etc.
- Session Management: UserSidebar, SessionTree, SessionWindowGrid, etc.
- Code Editor: CodeEditor, FileExplorer, ConflictDialog, DiffView, etc.
- Terminal: TerminalTabs, ClaudeCliTerminal, ClaudeCliStartDialog, etc.
- Controls: ControlButtons, QuickActionBar, StepInspector, etc.

HOOKS INVENTORY:
25 custom hooks covering:
- WebSocket & Events (6 hooks)
- Chain & Session State (4 hooks)
- Session Management (5 hooks)
- File & Editor Management (3 hooks)
- Terminal & CLI (3 hooks)
- User & Archive (2 hooks)
- UI Effects (4 hooks)

HIGH PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Complete Dashboard screens (3-4 weeks per screen)
2. Session archive enhancements (2 weeks)
3. Performance optimization - virtualization (1-2 weeks)
4. UX enhancements - shortcuts, errors, confirmations (2-3 weeks)

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- React 18.2 + TypeScript 5.4
- Vite 5.0 build tool
- Electron 28.0 (cross-platform)
- ReactFlow 11.10 (visualizations)
- Monaco Editor 4.7 (code editor)
- xterm.js 5.3 (terminal)

CODE QUALITY:
✅ Strong TypeScript usage
✅ Good separation of concerns
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Real-time WebSocket integration
⚠️ Some components could be more granular
⚠️ Error boundaries could be added
⚠️ Loading states not consistent

DEPLOYMENT:
- Vite dev server: port 5173
- Build targets: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Electron: NSIS, DMG, AppImage/deb/rpm
- App name: "ActionFlows Workspace"
