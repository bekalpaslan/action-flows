# Post-Completion

> Standard workflow after completing implementation work.

## Instructions

After core work is done:
1. **Commit** — Stage changed files, commit with descriptive message following project conventions
2. **Notify** — Post to project's communication channel (follow post-notification instructions). Currently not configured — skip and note in output.
3. **Update Status** — Update relevant status/progress files (if they exist)

Each step is independent — if one fails, continue with the others.
